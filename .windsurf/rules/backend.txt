This project uses Supabase as the backend.

Supabase provides:
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Auth via Supabase's built-in authentication
- Real-time subscriptions for data updates

When Supabase is not configured, the app falls back to `localStorage` for demo/offline mode.

Avoid hardcoding connection logic; rely on environment variables.

Use `completion_date`, `start_date`, and `category` fields to organize task data. Auth hooks must gracefully degrade if no session is active.
