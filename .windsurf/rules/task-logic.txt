This is a task management app displaying tasks in a 2-column layout per day:
- Work
- Personal

The app always loads with **today** by default.
Tasks are grouped by:
- Overdue (only shown under today's column)
- To-Dos (incomplete tasks with a start date of today)
- Completed (based on actual completion date)

Drag-and-drop behavior:
- Dragging between columns updates the task's `category`
- Dragging across days updates the `start_date`
- Dragging to a new day and column updates both

Tasks are filtered by `start_date`, not `due_date`.
Each day's Work and Personal columns are collapsible.

Daily 2-Column Layout
Each day is split into Work and Personal columns

The app always loads with today as the default view

You can scroll forward to future days

Task Placement Rules
Tasks are shown based on their start date

Active tasks (incomplete, with a start date of today or earlier) always appear under today

Completed tasks appear on the day they were completed

Due dates are not used in placement logic

Task Grouping Per Column
Each day’s Work and Personal column shows three sections:

Overdue – Only appears in today’s column

To-Dos – Incomplete tasks starting today

Completed – Tasks completed that day

🔁 Drag-and-Drop Behavior
Dragging between Work/Personal changes the task's category

Dragging to a different day updates the task’s start date

Dragging to a different column and day updates both start date and category

📂 Column Controls
Each Work and Personal column is collapsible, providing a clean, focused view.
