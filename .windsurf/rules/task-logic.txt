This is a task management app displaying tasks in a 2-column layout per day:
- Work
- Personal

The app always loads with **today** by default.
Tasks are grouped by:
- Overdue (only shown under today's column)
- To-Dos (incomplete tasks with a start date of today)
- Completed (based on actual completion date)

Drag-and-drop behavior:
- Dragging between columns updates the task's `category`
- Dragging across days updates the `start_date`
- Dragging to a new day and column updates both

Tasks are filtered by `start_date`, not `due_date`.
Each day's Work and Personal columns are collapsible.

Daily 2-Column Layout
Each day is split into Work and Personal columns

The app always loads with today as the default view

You can scroll forward to future days

Task Placement Rules
Tasks are shown based on their start date

Active tasks (incomplete, with a start date of today or earlier) always appear under today

Completed tasks appear on the day they were completed

Due dates are not used in placement logic

Task Grouping Per Column
Each day’s Work and Personal column shows three sections:

Overdue – Only appears in today’s column

To-Dos – Incomplete tasks starting today

Completed – Tasks completed that day

🔁 Drag-and-Drop Behavior
Dragging between Work/Personal changes the task's category

Dragging to a different day updates the task’s start date

Dragging to a different column and day updates both start date and category

📂 Column Controls
Each Work and Personal column is collapsible, providing a clean, focused view.

## Business Logic Guidelines
- Task Management:
  - Active tasks appear under their start date; completed tasks appear under their completion date.
  - Incomplete tasks never show on past days, they always rollover to the current day.  Completed tasks always show on the date completed.  Future tasks show based on the start date of the task.  Due date determines if they are overdue.
  - Dragging tasks between columns updates the category.  The categories are work and personal and we have a column for each under each day.
  - Dragging tasks across days updates the start date and category if applicable.  For example, you drag a task from work to personal then the category updates to personal.
  - Subtasks act as checklists within tasks. Ensure subtask completion syncs with parent task.
- Data Persistence:
  - Use Supabase for data storage. Fallback to localStorage for offline/demo mode.
- Decision Matrix:
  - Support full CRUD with offline fallback.
- Prepare for future enhancements: Dashboard, Sticky Notes, Daily Rituals.
