You are working in a modern frontend stack using the following technologies:
- Next.js for React server components and routing
- TypeScript (use strong typing and avoid `any`)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (prefer utility classes, no inline styles)
- Lucide React for icons
- date-fns for date formatting and comparisons
- React DnD for drag-and-drop (use hooks, maintain accessibility)
All components should be written using React functional components.
Prefer hooks over class-based logic. Group related logic into custom hooks.
