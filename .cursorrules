Backend/Database:
Supabase - Open source Firebase alternative providing:

Authentication
PostgreSQL database

Real-time subscriptions
State Management:
React's built-in hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
Custom hooks for task and authentication management
Development Tools:
npm/Node.js for package management
Next.js development server

The application is structured as a modern single-page application with server components, following the file-based routing pattern of Next.js. It has a fallback to localStorage when Supabase is not configured, allowing for offline or demo usage.

Business Functionality

Summary
THe app is a personal todo list tracker and management system.

Task Display Summary
The task manager displays tasks in a 2-column layout per day: Work and Personal. The app always opens with today as the default day, with the ability to scroll forward through future days.

📆 Task Placement Logic
Tasks are shown under their start date.

Active (incomplete) tasks with a start date of today or earlier always appear under today.

Completed tasks appear on the day they were completed, regardless of start date.

Due date is not used for filtering or placement.

🧩 Daily Task Grouping
Each day's columns are grouped into:

Overdue (shown only under today's date)

To-Dos (incomplete, starting today)

Completed (tasks finished on that day)

↔️ Drag-and-Drop Behavior
Dragging between columns (Work ↔ Personal) updates the task's category.

Dragging to another day updates the task’s start date to the target day.

Dragging to another day & column updates both the start date and category.

📂 Column Management
Each day's Work and Personal columns are collapsible, allowing for streamlined viewing.

Sticky note functionality allows dragging and dropping sticky notes from category to category.  Categories can be reordered by dragging.
